pointblank
----------

Tables can often be trustworthy, all the data 
you need is there and we can count on them to 
deliver us the information we need. But still, 
sometimes, the tables we trust are hiding things 
from us. Malformed strings, numbers we don't 
expect, missing values that ought not be missing. 
They can be hiding almost in plain view. This 
can be downright insidious and it can make us ask 
ourselves, "can we trust this table?"

Sure, we can sit down with a table during a 
long interrogation session and maybe get a 
bit rough with it with some SQL. Problem is, 
we have a lot of tables, and we usually have 
a lot of columns. Makes for long hours with 
lots of suspect tables.

We need a tool like pointblank. It lets us get 
up close with tables and unleash a fury of 
validation checks. Are some tables remote? 
That's no problem, we'll interrogate them from 
afar. So your Redshift tables can get the same 
line of questioning as your local data frames 
or those innocent-looking tibbles. Trust me, 
they'll talk and reveal what they're hiding. 

You don't have to type up a long report 
either, pointblank will take care of the 
paperwork. At the very least, you'll get a 
tidy data frame of the essentials. With a 
little planning, a very informative sitrep 
can be produced.
