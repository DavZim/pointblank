\description{
The \code{email_blast_preview()} function provides a preview of an email that
would normally be produced and sent through the \code{\link[=email_blast]{email_blast()}} function. The
\code{x} that we need for this is the agent x-list that is produced by the
\code{\link[=get_agent_x_list]{get_agent_x_list()}} function. Or, we can supply an agent object. In both
cases, the email message with appear in the Viewer and a \strong{blastula}
\code{email_message} object will be returned.
