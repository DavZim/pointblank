\title{Given an agent that is fully loaded with tasks, perform an interrogation}
\usage{
interrogate(
  agent,
  get_problem_rows = TRUE,
  get_first_n = NULL,
  sample_n = NULL,
  sample_frac = NULL,
  sample_limit = 5000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{An agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent}.}

\item{get_problem_rows}{An option to collect rows that didn't pass a
particular validation step. The default is \code{TRUE} and further options allow
for fine control of how these rows are collected.}

\item{get_first_n}{If the option to collect non-passing rows is chosen, there
is the option here to collect the first \code{n} rows here. Supply the number of
rows to extract from the top of the non-passing rows table (the ordering of
data from the original table is retained).}

\item{sample_n}{If the option to collect non-passing rows is chosen, this
option allows for the sampling of \code{n} rows. Supply the number of rows to
sample from the non-passing rows table. If \code{n} is greater than the number
of non-passing rows, then all the rows will be returned.}

\item{sample_frac}{If the option to collect non-passing rows is chosen, this
option allows for the sampling of a fraction of those rows. Provide a
number in the range of \code{0} and \code{1}. The number of rows to return may be
extremely large (and this is especially when querying remote databases),
however, the \code{sample_limit} option will apply a hard limit to the returned
rows.}

\item{sample_limit}{A value that limits the possible number of rows returned
when sampling non-passing rows using the \code{sample_frac} option.}
}
\value{
A \code{ptblank_agent} object.
}
\description{
The agent has all the information on what to do, so now all interrogations
can proceed efficiently, and, according to plan.

\examples{
# Create a simple data frame with
# two columns of numerical values
df <-
  data.frame(
    a = c(5, 7, 6, 5, 8, 7),
    b = c(7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3)
  )

# Validate that values in column
# `a` from `df` are always > 5,
# using `interrogate()` completes
# the process
agent <-
  create_agent(tbl = df) \%>\%
  col_vals_gt(column = vars(a), value = 5) \%>\%
  interrogate()
  
# Get a basic summary with
# `get_interrogation_summary()`
get_interrogation_summary(agent)[, 1:7]
