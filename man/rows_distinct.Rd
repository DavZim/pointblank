\title{Verify that row data are distinct}
\usage{
rows_distinct(
  x,
  columns = NULL,
  preconditions = NULL,
  actions = NULL,
  brief = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent}.}

\item{columns}{The column (or a set of columns, provided as a character
vector) to which this validation should be applied.}

\item{preconditions}{expressions used for mutating the input table before
proceeding with the validation. This is ideally as a one-sided R formula
using a leading \code{~}. In the formula representation, the \code{tbl} serves as the
input data table to be transformed (e.g.,
\code{~ tbl \%>\% dplyr::mutate(col = col + 10)}. A series of expressions can be
used by enclosing the set of statements with \code{{ }} but note that the \code{tbl}
object must be ultimately returned.}

\item{actions}{A list containing threshold levels so that the validation step
can react accordingly when exceeding the set levels. This is to be created
with the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} helper function.}

\item{brief}{An optional, text-based description for the validation step.}
}
\value{
A \code{ptblank_agent} object.
}
\description{
Verification step where the combination of row data across selected columns
should be distinct, or, contain no duplicates.
}
\examples{
# Create a simple data frame with
# three columns of numerical values
df <-
  data.frame(
    a = c(5, 7, 6, 5, 8, 7),
    b = c(7, 1, 0, 0, 8, 3),
    c = c(1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3)
  )

# Validate that when considering only
# data in columns `a` and `b`, there
# are no duplicate rows (i.e., all
# rows are distinct)
agent <-
  create_agent(tbl = df) \%>\%
  rows_distinct(vars(a, b)) \%>\%
  interrogate()

# Determine if these column
# validations have all passed
# by using `all_passed()`
all_passed(agent)
