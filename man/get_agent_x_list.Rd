\title{Get the agent's x-list}
\usage{
get_agent_x_list(agent, i = NULL, generate_report = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{An agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent}.}

\item{i}{The validation step number, which is assigned to each validation
step in the order of definition. If \code{NULL} (the default), the x list will
be of the post-interrogation form (complete information). If a valid step
number is provided then x-list will have partial information, that is, data
constrained to to interrogation result of the named step.}

\item{generate_report}{An option that governs whether an agent report should
be generated and be part of the output list. By default this is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} object.
}
\description{
The agent's x-list is a record of information that the agent possesses at any
given time. The x-list will contain the most information after an
interrogation has taken place. The x-list can be constrained to a particular
validation step (by supplying the step number to the \code{i} argument), or, we
can get the complete information by leaving \code{i} unspecified. The x-list is
indeed an R \code{list} object that contains a veritable cornucopia of
information.
