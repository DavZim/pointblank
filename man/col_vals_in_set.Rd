\usage{
col_vals_in_set(
  x,
  columns,
  set,
  preconditions = NULL,
  actions = NULL,
  brief = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame, tibble, or an agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent}.}

\item{columns}{The column (or a set of columns, provided as a character
vector) to which this validation should be applied.}

\item{set}{A vector of numeric or string-based elements, where column values
found within this \code{set} will be considered as passing.}

\item{preconditions}{expressions used for mutating the input table before
proceeding with the validation. This is ideally as a one-sided R formula
using a leading \code{~}. In the formula representation, the \code{tbl} serves as the
input data table to be transformed (e.g.,
\code{~ tbl \%>\% dplyr::mutate(col = col + 10)}. A series of expressions can be
used by enclosing the set of statements with \code{{ }} but note that the \code{tbl}
object must be ultimately returned.}

\item{actions}{A list containing threshold levels so that the validation step
can react accordingly when exceeding the set levels. This is to be created
with the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} helper function.}

\item{brief}{An optional, text-based description for the validation step.}
}
\value{
Either a \code{ptblank_agent} object or a table object, depending on what
was passed to \code{x}.
}
\description{
Verification step where numeric values in a table column should be part of a
set of values.
}
\examples{
# Create a simple data frame with
# 2 columns: one with numerical
# values and the other with strings
df <-
  data.frame(
    a = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
    b = c("one", "two", "three", "four"),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )

# Validate that all numerical values
# in column `a` belong to a numerical
# set, and, create an analogous 
# validation check for column `b` with
# a set of string values 
agent <-
  create_agent(tbl = df) \%>\%
  col_vals_in_set(
    columns = vars(a),
    set = 1:4
  ) \%>\%
  col_vals_in_set(
    columns = vars(b),
    set = c("one", "two",
            "three", "four")
  ) \%>\%
  interrogate()

# Determine if these column
# validations have all passed
# by using `all_passed()`
all_passed(agent)
