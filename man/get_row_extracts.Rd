\title{Get non-passing sample rows from a validation step}
\usage{
get_row_extracts(agent, i = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{An agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent}. It should have had
\code{\link[=interrogate]{interrogate()}} called on it, such that the validation steps were carried
out and any sample rows from non-passing validations could potentially be
available in the object.}

\item{i}{The validation step number, which is assigned to each validation
step in the order of definition.}
}
\value{
A list of tibbles if \code{i} is not provided, or, a tibble if \code{i} is
given.
}
\description{
Get row data that didn't pass a validation step. The amount of row data
available depends on both the fraction of rows that didn't pass a validation
step and the level of sampling or explicit collection from that set of rows
(this is defined within the \code{\link[=interrogate]{interrogate()}} call).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Set a seed
set.seed(23)

# Create a simple data frame with a
# column of numerical values
df <-
  data.frame(
    a = rnorm(100, 5, 2)
  )

# Create 2 simple validation steps
# that test whether values within
# column `a`
agent <-
  create_agent(tbl = df) \%>\%
  col_vals_between(
    columns = vars(a),
    left = 4, right = 6

  interrogate(
    extract_failed = TRUE,
    get_first_n = 10
  )

# Get row sample data for those rows
# in `df` that did not pass the first
# validation step (`col_vals_between`)
