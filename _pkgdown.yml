  - title: Create an Agent
    desc: >
      It all starts with a plan (and an *agent* to carry out that plan). The
      `create_agent()` function should be used before anything else. The agent
      here is told which table is the target. After this, we devise a stepwise
      validation plan with validation step functions.
    contents:
    - create_agent

  - title: Validation Step Functions
    desc: >
      Validation steps are either used with an **agent** object or, more simply,
      just with the table of interest. When used with an *agent*, each step
      function called works to build up a validation plan (which is executed
      with the `interrogate()` function). If used directly on data, then the
      data is checked and passed through. However, if we (1) set `warn_*` and/or
      `stop_*` thresholds and (2) the level of failed validation units exceeds
      those, then we'll get either a warning or a stop.

  - title: Interrogate and Get Info
    desc: >
      If we have an **agent** object that has a plan (i.e., validation steps),
      the `interrogate()` function instructs the *agent* to interrogate the
      `tbl` data. Once that is carried out, we can determine whether all
      validation steps have passed with flying colors (`all_passed()`), get a
      simple, table-based report of the interrogation (`get_agent_report()), or,
      examine the data units that didn't pass a particular validation step
      (`get_data_extracts()`).
